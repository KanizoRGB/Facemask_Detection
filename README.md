<h1 align="center">Face Mask Detection</h1>
<p>Face Mask Detection system built with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow using Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts in order to detect face masks in static images as well as in real-time video streams.</p>
</div>

## :muscle: Motivation
In the present scenario due to Covid-19, there is no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety. Also, the absence of large datasets of __â€˜with_maskâ€™__ images has made this task more cumbersome and challenging. 

## :warning: TechStack/framework used

- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [Caffe-based face detector](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [MobileNetV2](https://keras.io/api/applications/mobilenet/.)
- [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/api.html)

## :star: Usecase
Our face mask detector didn't use any morphed masked images dataset. The model is accurate, and since we used the CNN architecture, itâ€™s also computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.).

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.

## :file_folder: Dataset
The dataset used can be downloaded here - [Click to Download](https://github.com/techyhoney/Facemask_Detection/tree/master/dataset)

This dataset consists of __4000 images__ belonging to two classes:
*	__with_mask: 2000 images__
*	__without_mask: 2000 images__

The images used were real images of faces wearing masks. The images were collected from the following sources:

* [__Kaggle datasets__](https://www.kaggle.com/search?q=facemask+detection+in%3Adatasets)
* [__RMFD dataset__](https://github.com/X-zhangyang/Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset)
* [__Google Dataset Search__](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)
